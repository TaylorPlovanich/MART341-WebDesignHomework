## Aspect I’m Most Proud Of

The aspect of my website I’m most proud of is the **collage section** that showcases various images of wildlife. This feature visually captures the essence of the site’s theme by displaying different aspects of the natural world—wildlife. I will probably change images to include landscapes, plant life and anything nature related.

### Key Design Choices:
- **Consistency in Image Height**: I implemented CSS rules to ensure that all images maintain the same height while preserving their original aspect ratios. This helps keep the layout clean and avoids visual clutter.

- **Responsive Design**: The collage images automatically resize based on the screen size, ensuring a seamless and aesthetically pleasing experience for users on any device.

This section reflects my goal of creating an intuitive and visually appealing website that celebrates nature, allowing users to appreciate the beauty of wildlife and landscapes through both imagery and functionality.
