# Assignment 10 - FitLife Gym Webpage

## Page Information
- **Page Title**: FitLife Gym Home (index.html)
- **Purpose**: A promotional website for FitLife Gym designed to attract new members, showcase gym services, and provide contact information.

## Applied Techniques

### 1. External CSS Style Sheet
- **Description**: An external CSS file (`style/style.css`) is used to apply consistent styles across all pages. Separating HTML from CSS enhances maintainability and ensures design consistency throughout the site.

### 2. Class Selector
- **Description**: Class selectors are applied to style reusable sections, such as `.service-box` for gym services and `.contact form` for the contact page form. This approach keeps styles modular and easy to update.

### 3. ID Selector
- **Description**: ID selectors target unique elements, such as `#main-banner` for the main page banner and `#quote-author` for the featured quote author. Using IDs here ensures distinct styling for elements that only appear once on the page.

### 4. Additional Techniques
- **Background Colors**: Different background colors create clear sections across the site, helping to visually separate areas like the banner, about section, and services.
- **Font Colors**: The font colors reinforce the theme, with contrasting colors applied to headings, navigation links, and footer text for readability and branding.
- **Positioning**: Flexbox is used to position elements such as the navigation bar, service boxes, and form layout, ensuring a responsive and balanced layout.
- **Opacity**: Used to add slight transparency to overlay elements, creating a modern look in areas like the footer and contact form buttons.
- **Borders**: Borders are added around service boxes and form inputs to enhance structure and draw attention to interactive areas.
