### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Ingredients
- Gather all ingredients and preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
- Grease a loaf pan lightly with butter or non-stick spray to prevent sticking.

#### Step 2: Mash the Bananas
- In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until smooth.

#### Step 3: Add Butter and Sugar
- Mix in the melted butter and sugar with the mashed bananas, stirring until well combined.

#### Step 4: Add Wet Ingredients
- Add the beaten egg and vanilla extract to the bowl, stirring until everything is mixed evenly.

#### Step 5: Mix in Dry Ingredients
- Sprinkle in baking soda and salt, then mix.
- Slowly add the flour, stirring until no dry flour is visible, but be careful not to overmix.

#### Step 6: Pour the Batter
- Pour the batter into the greased loaf pan and spread it evenly.

#### Step 7: Bake
- Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

#### Step 8: Cool and Serve
- Remove the banana bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes.
- Turn the bread out onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing and serving.

### Additional Tips:
- For extra flavor, add 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, chopped nuts, or cinnamon to the batter.
- If your bananas are not very ripe, you can microwave them for a few seconds to soften.
- Banana bread stores well in an airtight container for up to 3 days at room temperature or in the fridge for a week.
