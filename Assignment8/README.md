# Weekly Overview

## 1. Div Elements
- **Div 1**: I used a div element to group the embedded audio and video content. This keeps the media section organized and allows me to apply consistent styling to this part of the page.
- **Div 2**: Another div was used to wrap the "Multimedia Gallery" section, where I grouped images and other media to keep the layout structured and visually cohesive.

## 2. Span Elements
- **Span 1**: I used a span element to style specific parts of text within a paragraph, helping highlight keywords related to the media content.
- **Span 2**: Another span was used within the caption of an image to emphasize the name of the photographer while keeping the rest of the caption in standard styling.

## 3. Audio Element
- **Audio 1**: I embedded an audio element that plays a nature soundscape. This gives users an immersive auditory experience while they browse the page, connecting them to the wildlife content.

## 4. Video Element
- **Video 1**: I included a video element that plays a short wildlife documentary clip. This allows users to visually engage with the nature theme in a dynamic way.

## 5. Iframe Element
- **Iframe 1**: I embedded an iframe to show an interactive map of Montana to find wildlife locations and sighting areas. Right now, it's just a general map of Montana.

## 6. Class
- **Class 1**: I created a .media-section class to style the entire media section of the page, making it easier to apply uniform padding, margins, and background colors to the audio and video elements.
- **Class 2**: Another class, .gallery-item, was created to ensure consistent formatting for images and their captions in the multimedia gallery.

## 7. Escape Character
- **Escape Character 1**: I used the escape character &amp; in the sentence "the relationship between birds & bees."
