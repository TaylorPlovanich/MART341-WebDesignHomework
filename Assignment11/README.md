# Assignment 11 - FitLife Gym Website

This is my web project for **Assignment 11**, where I created a webpage for an imaginary client, **FitLife Gym**. Below, I have documented how I applied each required technique for this assignment, and I've included the corresponding CSS code.

## Techniques Used

### 1. External CSS Style Sheet
- **Technique:** I created an external CSS file called `style.css` to separate my styles from the HTML content.
- **Reason:** This promotes cleaner code, easier maintenance, and better separation of concerns by keeping HTML structure and CSS styling separate.

### 2. Hover Effects for Interactivity
- **Technique:** I applied hover effects to the navigation links (`nav ul li a`) and service boxes (`.service-box`).
- **Reason:** Hover effects improve user interaction by visually indicating clickable elements, making the webpage more engaging and intuitive.

### 3. Self-Hosted Font (Roboto)
- **Technique:** I used the **Roboto** font from Google Fonts for headings (`h1, h2, h3`) and the body font.
- **Reason:** Using a consistent, clean font like **Roboto** improves readability and creates a modern, professional feel.

### 4. Font from a Font Library (Roboto)
- **Technique:** I imported the **Roboto** font from Google Fonts for headings and body text.
- **Reason:** This adds a professional touch and improves readability with a sleek, modern design.

### 5. Experiment with Different Font Styles
- **Technique:** I experimented with using **Roboto** for both headings and body text, creating a cohesive and consistent design.
- **Reason:** Using the same font for multiple types of text keeps the design simple and professional while maintaining clarity.

### 6. Adjust Font Weight for Emphasis
- **Technique:** I adjusted the font-weight of the navigation links to `bold` to give them emphasis and make them stand out.
- **Reason:** Bold text makes important elements, like navigation links, more noticeable and easier to read.

### 7. Use Text Decoration to Add or Remove Underlines
- **Technique:** I used `text-decoration: none` for navigation links and `text-decoration: underline` for links in other sections to differentiate clickable elements.
- **Reason:** Removing the underline from navigation links improves the clean look, while adding it to other links ensures they're clearly identified as interactive.

### 8. Adjust Spacing (Letter Spacing and Line Height)
- **Technique:** I applied `letter-spacing: 0.1em` to the main banner text and adjusted `line-height` in certain sections for better readability.
- **Reason:** Proper spacing makes text more readable and enhances visual appeal, especially in headings and large text.

### 9. Align Text or Elements for a Clean Layout
- **Technique:** I used `text-align: center` for elements like the navigation bar and content sections to create a balanced and clean layout.
- **Reason:** Center-aligning text ensures a more aesthetically pleasing and uniform design, especially for titles and important content.

### 10. Use Pseudo-Elements and Pseudo-Classes for Additional Styling
- **Technique:** I used `:hover` pseudo-class for the navigation links and service boxes to add interactive effects like color changes and scaling.
- **Reason:** Pseudo-classes enhance user experience by providing visual feedback when users interact with certain elements.
