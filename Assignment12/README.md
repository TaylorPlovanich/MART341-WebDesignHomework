# Assignment 12 - FitLife Gym Reviews Page

This is an additional webpage for the **FitLife Gym** website, focusing on client reviews. Below, I have documented how and why I applied the required techniques for this assignment.

## Techniques Used

### 1. Sizing
- **Technique:** I used `width` and `height` to size the review cards uniformly.
- **Reason:** This ensures all reviews appear balanced and consistent in design, regardless of content length.

### 2. Overflow
- **Technique:** I used `overflow: hidden` to manage long review text and added ellipses with `text-overflow: ellipsis`.
- **Reason:** This maintains a clean layout by preventing excessive text from disrupting the design.

### 3. Border
- **Technique:** I added borders to the review cards with a slight shadow for emphasis.
- **Reason:** This separates each review visually, making the page easier to navigate.

### 4. Margin
- **Technique:** I applied `margin` between review cards and other sections for spacing.
- **Reason:** Proper spacing improves readability and prevents elements from feeling crowded.

### 5. Padding
- **Technique:** I added `padding` inside review cards to separate the content from the edges.
- **Reason:** This improves readability by giving text enough breathing room within the card.

### 6. Dropdown Menu
- **Technique:** I created a dropdown menu with options to filter reviews by rating or date.
- **Reason:** A dropdown allows users to sort or filter reviews easily, enhancing user experience.

### 7. Position
- **Technique:** I used `position: relative` for the review container and `position: absolute` for icons within the review cards.
- **Reason:** Positioning elements strategically ensures a neat and interactive design.
